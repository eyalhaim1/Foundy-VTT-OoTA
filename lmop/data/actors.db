first time you see those hollow sockets staring back at you with some semblance of thought inside the skull, I advise to quash any feelings of accomplishment.  The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.  Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.  Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant’s tasks with exceeding care.  Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.  The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.  The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.  Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.  The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.  With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.  Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.  The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.  Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.  One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.  Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.  Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.  Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p><p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p><p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. </p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p><p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. </p><p><strong>Replacing the Book</strong> </p><p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. </p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3>\n<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3>\n<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table.

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Evocation</h2>\n<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7uzJ2JkmsdRGLra3]{Evocation Savant} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.6VBXkjjBgjSpNElh]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.evEWCpE5MYgr5RRW]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.7O85kj6uDEG5NzUE]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.VUtSLeCzFubGXmGx]{Overchannel}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"","hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":0},"sort":0,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xRQDu0GrQB9EpCYM","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1stlevel wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">—Spell Slots per Spell Level—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.
